## List all anagrams of words contained within a file
Two words are defined as anagrams if they do share the same letters, but are in a different order (i.e.
the english words race and care are anagrams).
<br />
Given an input file which contains one word per line, as an output construct a list of all anagrams
from that input file. Print those words to the console, where all words that are an anagram should
each other should be on the same line.


As an example, given the input file:
<br />
act
<br />
cat
<br />
tree
<br />
race
<br />
care
<br />
acre
<br />
bee


the output should be:
<br />
act cat
<br />
acre care race

### Tasks
1) Write a Java program that solves the above task and verify this using the attached sample.txt. Do
not worry about extensive error handling, but focus on readibility.
2) Attach a README documenting the necessary steps to build and run your program.
3) Attach a document explaining any design decisions you have made. Consider aspects such as
Maintainability, Scalability, Performance, etc. If you decide to use external libraries, make sure to
justify why you picked them.
4) How will your application cope with larger datasets, say 10 Million Words, and 100 Billion
Words? If you wanted to cover these cases, how would you scale your application?


### Notes
There is no strict deadline for this assignment. However, please not that we will not be able to
proceed with your application until you have completed this task. Please send your completed
solution back as one .zip file.
